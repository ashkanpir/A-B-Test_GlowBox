# Glow Box A/B Test Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of an A/B test conducted to evaluate the impact of a new feature or change (referred to as "Glow Box") on user engagement and conversion rates. The analysis includes initial data checks, data cleaning, and the application of statistical tests to determine the significance of observed differences between control and test groups.

## Key Features
- **Sanity Checks:** Initial validation steps to ensure the data integrity and consistency before proceeding with the main analysis.
- **Statistical Testing:** Conducts hypothesis testing to compare conversion rates and other key metrics between the control and test groups.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses visualizations to present the A/B test results clearly and effectively, aiding in the interpretation of findings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **SciPy/Statsmodels**: Used for performing statistical tests to assess the results of the A/B test.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to display the results.

## Data
- The dataset includes user information segmented by various factors such as `uid`, `country`, `gender`, `device`, `group` (control or test), `join date`, `conversion status`, and `amount spent`.
  
## Results
- The analysis provides insights into whether the new feature "Glow Box" leads to statistically significant changes in user behaviour compared to the control group.
- Findings are summarized with recommendations based on the results of the A/B testing.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and view the visualizations.
